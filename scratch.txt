Assuming you have Windows 10 machine, to use redis we need to install redis for which we will need to enable linux subsystem on your windows machine. Follow these steps to enable Linux subsystem.
- not necessary, but in case you have critical data on your system back it up
- Then either restart your machine or close all windows program
- Open powershell with admin privileges (type powershell in search bar, right click, open as Admin)
- type following command in powershell and let it run
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux

- Once installed let it reboot (it wil update system software) and may reboot more than once.

The steps are also documented here: https://redis.com/blog/redis-on-windows-10/

Sell one $SPX put per day, -.06 —.07delta, 45 days out. 
(Of course this can be done with SPY on smaller accounts)
Exit (purchase back) at 50% profit. This earns approximately $600-$700 per day x 22 trading days per month = $13,200-$15,400 profit. 
Losses:
If market drops & premium  you had received triples,
ie: $14.00 put becomes $42.00 during a falling market, then exit at this price ($28.00) loss. 
Doomsday Scenario/Black Swan:
Purchase $VIX calls, once per month, at .10 to .15 delta. 
1% of portfolio total (1,000 per $100k account) should go into this.  0.25% 120 days out, each & every month. 
(During the March 2020 crash, this covered all losses plus gave profit). You will have 30,60,90,120 dte calls. 
This is protection against:
Black Monday, doomsday, Covid (2020) & Black Swan events. 
So far YTD:
Two losses in January, One loss in May.
Profit in 2021 YTD: $105,000. (1 put sold)


(I believe he said days in trade is about 11. So with about 22 trading days in a month, he can cycle capital twice. Number of contracts/trades to deploy obviously depend on one's account size and risk tolerance (it's undefined risks trades).)

[Strategy]
 Q: How about using a spread to reduce the capital requirements ?
 A: Adam - This strategy is a put selling strategy.
 
 [Alternative]:
 this is a great thread and great idea! I'm going to start on Monday but I would like some input on the following. I can't sell every day and do not prefer to have as many open positions. To get my feet wet I was planning on selling 5 SPY on Monday and then 5 SPY on Thursday for a couple of months. Eventually ramp it up to sell 20 SPY on Monday and 20 SPY on Thursday. This way I have two trades per week at the equivalent of 4 SPX on a weekly basis.
 Initially just stick with the plan to sell at 6 to 7 delta at 45 DTE and sell at 50% profit or sell at 3x premium received (for a loss).
 When ramped up to 20 on Mon and 20 on Thu, sell 1/2 at 50% profit and the other half at 75% profit. Same stop-loss of 3x premium received.
 Thoughts and opinions welcome!


[BuyingPower/Margin]
 Q: How big of an account with portfolio margin to safely run this
 A: Adam - Probably 300k for SPX. 30k for SPY...depending on your broker. (SPY == XSP --less liquidity)
 A: You can do this with /ES with <$4K buying power per trade.

 A: Adam - For me it’s 20k in buying power held. Since I’m selling 2 per day, and average time in trade is 11 days, that’s approximately $1300 per day on the 40k held. Equal to 6% per month. 72% per year.
 (IB needs ~40K)

 Q: How much do you hold in cash vs BP used to sustain this strategy
 A: Adam - ranges from 20-60%

 A: A 3800 strike put (~5 delta at this time) will cost you about $38k in margin.
    So assuming you have enough for 15 or so days x $30-40k each in margin this works. 
    It's roughly $500k in total. Edit, I have a regular margin account with TOS. Not portfolio margin.

 Q: Selling just one put requires $383000.00 in margin for SPX. Nneed $8 million in your account and that's just for the opening margin. If the market moves against you that number could easily swell to $24 million.
 A: Portfolio margin only requires 9% BPR. The stops would kick in long before and margin expansion occurs.

 Q: The amount of capital for this strategy as you do it .. I do have a good margin account.
 A: SPY: BP of 4.5K
    SPX: BP of 38.0K For a 7 Delta 44DTE

[Returns]
 Q: Why does your p&l vastly outperform David Sun’s 45DTE strategy?
 A: DavidSun - I trade 3-4 SPY contracts each day. Adam Narbonne trades 2 SPX a day. He’s literally trading 5-6 times larger than I am

VIX Hedge (CBOE Market Volatality):
* Calls are ~ 45-55 Vix [Losing them all wouldnt be that bad. If you’re trying to make 20% annual return, assuming a 35% capture rate, you’d only be selling 0.22% worth of premium for each entry. If you lost a 10 position book that would only be 4.5% drawdown to your account. Even losing a 17 position book (high unlikely) is only a 7.6% drawdown.]
If you pay 0.25% of total portfolio 120DTE, once per month. 
Does that means that you are using 3% (0.25% x 12 mths) in total annually and protected by 1% of your total portfolio at any time?
 Q: Does your total portfolio size only mean the SPX trades net liq or the total of your stocks and options portfolio net liq? Only SPX/SPY
 A: Adam: Let’s say your account size is 500 K, you would spend 5000 divided by four, which is 1250 per month
 Q: Does your definition of account size refer to the total buying power blocked for all the SPX trades we have?
 A: Yes Sir. Exactly.

 A: Adam - 1% of my account is divided by 4. Each month I spend .3% on Vix calls. 120 dte. Usually at monthly expiration time.
You will eventually have 120,90,60,30 dte calls.
Yes, I let them expire unless there is a crash large enough to increase the Vix to 40. I may then sell some.
Keep in mind that there are 2 hedges at play here. 3x exit, AND the Vix calls.

Sell VIX?
No, I would not sell the ViX calls, unless the ViX reaches 40+, or market crashes. If 3x stop is triggered, strategy says just exit, & sell another as normal for the day

Timing:
 Don’t really have to worry about time of entry.
MarketDrop:
On Market Drop And You get Stopped on a bunch of positions
I would exit at 3x, and try to make up some ground if the Vix hits 40 or higher.
Vix calls are only sold in the event of a crash. Above 40 vix

Adam - So if I exit at 3x/4x (which was what happened during Covid) I would probably exit some positions when theVix hits 40 and then more at 50 or 60.



[Risks]
Q: We are in a strong bull market right now. It works well when the black swans are hibernating. Would be interesting to see how it would work in tougher years
A: Adam - It actually holds up rather well in bear markets.

Q: So if all 22 trades in the month goes against you it could wipe out $79k. I assume the VIX hedge would cover this in a black swan, Covid case. But what if there wasn’t a black swan? Maybe not all 22 will lose.
A: David - Average book size is 10 and max book size is 17. You’re almost never gonna lose 17 at once.


[Misc]:
I do a similar strategy but with /ES and i sell +10% ITM beginning of year.
Hedge is with sell aggressive ES calls and VIX wide call spread and Risk Twist Spreas
* seasonally these next two months are weak so I would prefer to do it when the market's hotter during that November to April time frame. markets are up 2/3 of the time. It just might take longer to close out puts in the slower times of the year.

[ES]MES 1 point => $5
[NQ]MNQ 1 point => $2

[MES/MNQ/M2K/MYM - Sunday 5 PM CT - Friday 4 PM CT (Trading Halt from 3:15 PM to 3:30 PM Monday-Friday)] 
*note: check listing cycle & expiration schedule on cmegroup.com
I certainly wouldn't do it; but I also don't have that much BP available. I personally use the David Sun 45DTE strategy; but use /ES options instead.
However, it would love to have the ability to set a stop loss at 3x credit received, which you can't do with /ES. I also like /ES since I really can't look at the market during the day, but instead can put on all of my trades at night.

Can this strategy work using the same mechanics but on /es futures and with a spread rather than naked (say 50 points wide) to reduce BP? IBKR seems to allow me to apply a GTC stop to futures orders so that would be ok. But my concern is whether using a spread rather than naked would affect the way the trade works, or whether it wouldn't make much difference?
Adam - Spreads behave kind of weird so I don’t know. If you are trading on /ES there’s reallt no need for a spread. The capital efficiency is already very high so that would just be leverage on top of leverage.
Very true - but the reason I ask is because the premium for selling say 8 contracts of a 50-wide put spread at delta 6 in /ES would be about $850 and require about $5K in BP. The naked put by contrast would require $12.5K in BP and only bring in $540 in credit.
